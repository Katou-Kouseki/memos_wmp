> Note: This is a WeChat mini program. To publish a mini program on WeChat, you need a domain name that has been filed in China. According to recent policies, the mini program itself also requires additional filing, which is quite troublesome!

### How to use？
1. Preparation: A domain name that has been registered in China, pointing to a well-built memos web project (note that the version number is 0.13.1). The old version may not work properly due to changes in the API. You can search for a suitable version in the releases, but note that it has fewer features compared to the latest version.
2. Please apply for a WeChat mini program. Choose the category "Tools-Reminder" and in the development management section, fill in the field "Request legal domain name" with the domain name you have set up for "memos".
